I developed a machine learning-based email/SMS spam detection system, following a process that included: 
1) data cleaning, 
2) exploratory data analysis (EDA), 
3) text preprocessing, 
4) model building, 
5) evaluation, 
6) implementation, and 
7) deployment via a web interface.  
The project leveraged Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK, and Scikit-learn.  While several classification algorithms were tested, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Extra Trees Classifier yielded the best performance.  These top-performing models were trained and persisted using pickle.  A real-time web interface was then created using Streamlit.  This project offers substantial potential for future enhancements and practical applications.
